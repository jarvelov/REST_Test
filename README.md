# REST_Test

##Description
This project was a test I was given as part of a job interview. The task was to create a REST api which could:

    * Create a user from a JSON request
    * List a user
    * List all users

A user needed to have the following properties:

    * Name
    * Username
    * Email
    * Password

For this project I ended up using:

    * [Angular JS](http://angularjs.org/)
    * [Flight PHP framework[](http://flightphp.com/)
    * [SQLite 3](https://www.sqlite.org/)
    * [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
    * [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).

I learned a lot about AngularJS on the way, which was a lot of fun.
